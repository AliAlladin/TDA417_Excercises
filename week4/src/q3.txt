I think the key is to add an extra variable to the nodes that hold the order in which the nodes were added to the queue
and then if we're working with a queue we can make sure that the first element added to the que is always on top and can
be removed in the right order. If we're implementing a stack instead we can make sure that the latest element added to
the priority queue is on the top.
