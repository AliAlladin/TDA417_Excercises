Q4. Because it's first in first out and the integers are enqueued in ascending order there is only one possible sequence
    and that is the same sequence they were enqueued in. And thats also the general rule that the only possible sequence
    is the same sequence the integers were enqueued in.

Q5. If we can find a decreasing subsequence [a_m ... a_n] and if there exists a_m > a_k > a_n and a_k hasn't occurred in
    the sequence before this subsequence then the sequence is invalid.
