Hash tables with separate chaining:
    - Add, delete and get should take constant time.
    - All elements that collide should be stored at the same index.
    -

Hash tables with linear probing:
    - Add, delete and get should take constant time.
    - Each index can hold maximum 1 element.
    - The index where an element is removed from must hold an deleted object.
